## Web FUNdamentals

This project was meant to try web dev tools I am less comfortable with. Such as Git. 
I have learn more about Git and GitBash commands and remembered Javascript basics. 

## Usage

Open developer tools in Chrome, then if you choose "console" you will see a list. Each time you reload page you will get different option.

## License

For this project I chose MIT license.
